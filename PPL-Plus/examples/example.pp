#ifndef __pplplus
 When defining a macro with parameters, issues can arise if an argument
 name is adjacent to a letter. To resolve this, you can use numbered
 placeholders like `1$` for the first argument, `2$` for the second, `3$`
 for the third, and so on. This ensures the macro arguments remain uniquely
 identifiable and avoid issues, note that $0 is the identifier.
