## Command-Line Tools
The command-line tools are are installed at `/Applications/HP/PrimeSDK/bin`.

#### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PrimePlus/tree/main/README.md">PPL+</a> Pre-Processor for PPL
PPL+ is a pre-processor that improves readability and maintainability of HP PPL code. It supports custom regex rules, can extract PPL source from .hpprgm and .hpappprgm files, and can also compress PPL source into a compact, optimized form for the HP Prime.

#### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PPL-Minifier/tree/main/README.md">Minifier & Compressor</a> for PPL Code
Minification of your code results in it taking up less space, making it use less storage of your HP Prime's storage memory giving you more space for more programs.

>[!NOTE]
>This tool is deprecated. ppl+ now provides this functionality, so the utility is no longer relevant and will not receive further updates.

#### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PPL-Reformat/tree/main/README.md">Reformater</a> for PPL Code
Reformating your code enforce a consistent coding style throughout your project, making it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase. It helps maintain a uniform look and feel, which can enhance code readability. Readability: Well-formatted code is easier to read and understand.

#### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/GROB/tree/main/README.md">GROB</a> for PPL Code
A utility that generates PPL code from image files for use with the **<a href="https://www.github.com/Insoft-UK/PPL-Minifier/tree/main/examples/GROB.prgm">GROB</a>** library, enabling the creation of graphic objects for use with the BLIT and BLIT_P functions on the HP Prime calculator.

#### Adafruit GFX <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PPL-Font/tree/main/README.md">Font Converter</a>
A handy utility for converting Adafruit_GFX .h files to the .prgm format, for use with the **<a href="https://www.github.com/Insoft-UK/PPL-Minifier/tree/main/examples/HP.prgm">HP</a>** library to render Adafruit GFX fonts.

#### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/hpprgm/tree/main/README.md">HP Prime Program Tool</a>
This utility tool provides the ability to extract **PPL** code from an HP Prime `.hpprgm` file.  The tool can also convert source code .prgm file/s to .hpprgm G1 format, while G1 is the old .hpprgm format it's still supported by the HP Prime Connectivity Kit and will be converted to the latest .hpprgm fornat.
