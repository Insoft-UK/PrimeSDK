# Command-Line Tools for macOS
The command-line tools are bundled with Xprime. While they are used internally by Xprime, they can also be accessed externally via the terminal. They are located at `/Applications/Xprime.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin`.

If only PrimeSDK is installed, the command-line tools are located at `/Applications/HP/PrimeSDK/bin`.

### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PrimePlus/tree/main/README.md">PPL+</a> Pre-Processor for PPL
PPL+ is a pre-processor designed to improve code maintainability and readability in the HP Programming Language (PPL). PPL+ also allows one to define regular expressions to assist in the preprocessing workflow. The final output is a compact, optimized PPL program file tailored to the HP Primeâ€™s limited storage capacity.

### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PPL-Minifier/tree/main/README.md">Minifier & Compressor</a> for PPL Code
Minification of your code results in it taking up less space, making it use less storage of your HP Prime's storage memory giving you more space for more programs.

### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PPL-Reformat/tree/main/README.md">Reformater</a> for PPL Code
Reformating your code enforce a consistent coding style throughout your project, making it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase. It helps maintain a uniform look and feel, which can enhance code readability. Readability: Well-formatted code is easier to read and understand.

### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/GROB/tree/main/README.md">GROB</a> for PPL Code
A utility that generates PPL code from image files for use with the **<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insoft-UK/PrimeSDK/main/Xcode/Developer/usr/hpprgm/GROB.hpprgm">GROB</a>** library, enabling the creation of graphic objects for use with the BLIT and BLIT_P functions on the HP Prime calculator.

### Adafruit GFX <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PPL-Font/tree/main/README.md">Font Converter</a>
A handy utility for converting Adafruit_GFX .h files to the .prgm format, for use with the **<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insoft-UK/PrimeSDK/main/Xcode/Developer/usr/hpprgm/HP.hpprgm">HP</a>** library to render Adafruit GFX fonts.

### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/hpprgm/tree/main/README.md">HP Prime Program Tool</a>
This utility tool provides the ability to extract **PPL** code from an HP Prime `.hpprgm` file.  The tool can also convert source code .prgm file/s to .hpprgm G1 format, while G1 is the old .hpprgm format it's still supported by the HP Prime Connectivity Kit and will be converted to the latest .hpprgm fornat.
