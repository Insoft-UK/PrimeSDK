<h1>PrimeSDK for macOS</h1>

<b>P+</b> is a proprietary pre-processor utility designed to improve code maintainability and readability in the HP Programming Language (PPL). It serves as an intermediary language that introduces features such as substitutions and modular code organization. P+ also allows users to define regular expressions to assist in the preprocessing workflow. The final output is a compact, optimized PPL program file tailored to the HP Primeâ€™s limited storage capacity.
<br/><br/>
P+ is essentially the PPL language with additional features, such as substitution capabilities, and requires all keywords to be in lowercase.
