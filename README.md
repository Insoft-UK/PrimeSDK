P+ is a proprietary programming language designed to mitigate the challenges associated with code maintenance and comprehensibility in the HP Programming Language (PPL). P+ serves as an intermediary language that addresses these issues by introducing support for substitutions and facilitating code organization. The final output is a PPL program file with a minimal footprint, optimized to conserve the limited storage space available on the HP Prime.
<br/><br/>
P+ is essentially the PPL language with additional features, such as substitution capabilities, and requires all keywords to be in lowercase.

>[NOTE!]
**p+**, **pplmin**, **pplref**, and **grob** are installed in **/usr/local/bin**. To uninstall them manually, just drag these four files to the trash.
