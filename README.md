### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PrimeSDK/tree/main/PPL+/README.md">PPL+</a> Pre-Processor for PPL
PPL+ is a pre-processor utility designed to improve code maintainability and readability in the HP Programming Language (PPL). PPL+ also allows one to define regular expressions to assist in the preprocessing workflow. The final output is a compact, optimized PPL program file tailored to the HP Primeâ€™s limited storage capacity.

>[!WARNING]
The **auto** feature will be removed in future releases of PPL+. It is recommended to avoid using auto aliases going forward. The **auto feature** in the PPL+ preprocessor has become largely redundant. It was originally intended to help generate compressed code, but since the introduction of a separate tool dedicated to code compression and minimization, its continued presence in PPL+ is unnecessary. In fact, it somewhat contradicts the core purpose of PPL+ itself. As a result, this feature is expected to be removed in a future update.

### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PrimeSDK/tree/main/PPL-Minifier/README.md">Minifier & Compressor</a> for PPL Code
Minification of your code results in it taking up less space, making it use less storage of your HP Prime's storage memory giving you more space for more programs.

### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PrimeSDK/tree/main/PPL-Reformat/README.md">Reformater</a> for PPL Code
Reformating your code enforce a consistent coding style throughout your project, making it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase. It helps maintain a uniform look and feel, which can enhance code readability. Readability: Well-formatted code is easier to read and understand.

### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PrimeSDK/tree/main/GROB/README.md">GROB</a> for PPL Code
A utility for generating PPL code from an image file for use with the BLIT and BLIT_P functions on the HP Prime.

### Adafruit GFX <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PrimeSDK/tree/main/PPL-Font/README.md">Font Converter</a>
This is a handy utility that goes well with the original fontconvert tool provided by Adafruit for converting Adafruit_GFX .h to Adafruit_GFX .hpprgm format.

### <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PrimeSDK/tree/main/hpprgm/README.md">HP Prime Program Tool</a>
This utility tool provides the ability to extract **PPL** code from an HP Prime `.hpprgm` file.
