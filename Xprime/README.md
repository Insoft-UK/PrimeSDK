>[!NOTE]
**Xprime** is currently in its early stages. While it can open, save, and edit code, it also now supports exporting code as .prgm or .hprgm files.
Xprime is installed outside the HP folder in your Applications directory. It will in future include the PrimeSDK, providing a GUI interface to the command-line tools.
