Welcome to P+

P+ is a proprietary programming language designed to improve code maintenance and readability in the HP Programming Language (PPL). Acting as an intermediary language, P+ introduces support for substitutions and better code organization, making development more efficient.

The final output is a compact and optimized PPL program file, minimizing storage usage on the HP Prime calculator.

P+ extends PPL by adding powerful features like substitution capabilities while enforcing lowercase keywords for consistency.
