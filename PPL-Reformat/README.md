# Reformater for PPL Code
Reformating your code enforce a consistent coding style throughout your project, making it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase. It helps maintain a uniform look and feel, which can enhance code readability. Readability: Well-formatted code is easier to read and understand.

> [!NOTE]
The PPL file must be in UTF-16LE format, and at this time, .hpprgrm files with header and footer are not supportedâ€”only raw code is accepted currently.
