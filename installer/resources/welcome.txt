Welcome to P+

P+ is a proprietary programming language designed to improve code maintenance and readability in the HP Programming Language (PPL). Acting as an intermediary language, P+ introduces support for substitutions and better code organization, making development more efficient.

The final output is a compact and optimized PPL program file, minimizing storage usage on the HP Prime calculator.

P+ extends PPL by adding powerful features like substitution capabilities while enforcing lowercase keywords for consistency.

This version keeps the technical details while making it more engaging for users installing the software. Let me know if youâ€™d like any further refinements!
